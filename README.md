## (remove me) Student Instructions

You will fill out this README with your project updates as you commit and push code. **This README file should be edited on your raspberry pi.** Additionally, you will need to push your code *back to Github* after you finish each lab, so that you can create a working **tree** of all your changes. If you don't know how mange Github commits and pushing files to the cloud, see [the instructions on the Github Setup Page](https://byu-cpe.github.io/ecen224/lab-setup/). Remove this section before submitting.
